As described by Hila Fisherman, Curator of the exhibit at University of Pennsylvania, Here, figures are shown in context, as they move about in the public space, unaware of the photographer’s presence. Even the later outdoor photographs that were clearly staged show larger and more diverse groups of people in natural contexts, a stark difference from the typical 19th century uniform constructions of both “empty” landscape and Exotic, character-type portraits.
