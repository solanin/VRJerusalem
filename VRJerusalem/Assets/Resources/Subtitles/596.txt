As described by Hila Fisherman, Curator of the exhibit at University of Pennsylvania, landscapes and ancient sites featured prominently in 19th century photography as physical testimony of the biblical past. Human figures were absent from early daguerreotypes mainly due to technical constraints. Unlike their more romantic or idealized painted versions, Holy Land religious sites often differed from their imagined appearance; at times they were barely visible or decaying.
