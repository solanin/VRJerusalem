## Re-imagining the Past with VR

This project takes a new spin on century old stereograph images, converting images to a virtual reality space. The idea is to give a new life to these images, and tell the story behind the moments captured in a radically different period than our own. The viewer will be presented with a historic photo, then get a glimpse of what each area looks like today. The goal is to emerge an audience in a historic time period in a area foreign to many.
