## Re-imagining the Past with VR

VR Jerusalem is an app that takes stereographs and presents them for google cardboard. This project takes a new spin on century old stereograph images, converting images to a virtual reality space. The idea is to give a new life to these images, and tell the story behind the moments captured in a radically different period than our own. The viewer will be presented with a historic photo. The goal is to emerge an audience in a historic time period in a area foreign to many.
By having these images available in an application, they can be much more accessible to the public, museums can put them on display, they can be more easily shared, and there is 0 risk of damage to the historical documents themselves.
